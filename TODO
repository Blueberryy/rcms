Todo:
    ✔ Modify GetFallDamage in sv_hooks to do something when a player takes fall damage when they already have a broken leg. @done(19-12-31 23:07)
    ☐ Refactor the limbs system
    ☐ Proper icons to show in chat.
    ✘ Change string matches to unique IDs @cancelled(19-12-31 19:03)  
        Not worth the hassle.
    ☐ Possibly alter F1 menu with wounds.
    ✔ Rather than calculate fall damage injuries through velocity, use the Clockwork.limb library to see if their limb health is below a certain level to apply injuries. @done(19-12-31 23:07)

Known issues:
    ☐ When using the HealthStatus command, an error will occur if the player has an invalid wound in their character data.
        Occurs because LText() uses localization to print their wound, so if the wound is invalid, LText() will fail. Fixed by resetting player's wounds with /HealthReset <playerName>.
